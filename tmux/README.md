# My tmux setup

`init.sh` contains commands required to start my tmux sessions. It uses tmuxp as the session
manager. I have a declarative config of how my sessions look like. Found inside the tmuxp folder.

The segments folder contains scripts for various things which was used in my older tmux setup. They
are not used anymore.
