# Dotfiles

This is a collection of tools, configuration files, shell aliases, and scripts
to setup my - *very opinonated* - working environment.

Mainly it has:

* Vim (My favourite editor)
* Tmux (Must have - because most of my time is spent inside a terminal)
* Zsh (The most awesome shell ever!)
* Git, SSH
* rsync
* Emacs (for org-mode backend)
* And a lot of vim plugins :)


# Usage

If you want to use this, then I recommend to go through the various
setup/config files to modify them according to your needs.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to edit the `gitconfig` file, to have your credentials!

Once done modifying, to install the environment, just the run the `install`
script.

```
$ ./install
```

PS: Currently, only Arch Linux, Debian and CentOS/RHEL based distros are supported.
